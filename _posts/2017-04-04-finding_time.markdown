I get that email week after week from Learn that starts with, "Hi Lena, Thereâ€™s no way around it: learning to code is hard," and then I don't open it because I'm afraid it will be reprimanding me for how little I've accomplished in the past seven days. "Coding is hard, but you don't have to move so slowly!" 

It's been a tough ride finding the time to study between four part-time jobs accompanied by slow wifi and an even slower laptop. I've blocked out my study time and it always feels like something holds me up, but hey, it's also my first month and we all have to give ourselves time to get the hang of things. 

Some things I have had to get the hang of: learning chemistry in Italian, learning elementary math in French, Horton modern dance technique, the ugly in-between length of my hair right now, living in Brooklyn. 

Most of these pursuits ended well, though I'm still waiting on my hair to make up its mind. 

In high school, I learned not to consider anything a waste of time. Everything I did, whether intentionally or not, was something I could learn from and even derive joy from. This changed the way I viewed my friends, my labors, my failures. Especially in college, as I had to push myself in classes that I had no interest in, I constantly reminded myself that those would enrich and give depth to my studies. Some people criticise the Liberal Arts for being useless, but I see nothing wrong with aspiring to be well-rounded. 

Now, as I put on so many hats in a day - teacher, administrator, caretaker, bartender, student - I'm reminded that I am able to do these things because they are valuable for a reason and I have practiced so much to become multi-faceted. This program is one more valuable facet that I consider to be an excellent use of time, even though many days I don't know where that time is. When I work through a lab and type "learn submit" or when I can see the ways my learning has changed the way I think at my jobs, I feel immense gratification and can feel myself growing. As the days get longer and I find more and more spaces to work and ways of ironing out my schedule, I look forward to spending more time here.
