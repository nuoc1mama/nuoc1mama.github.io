I was so excited to get more into Object Oriented Ruby. As an artist, I love metaphors and objects! I love parsing out theory and meaning, lengthy critical analysis, the comfort and flexibility of uncertainty. 

As I got further into OO, though, it became more and more difficult for me to grasp the concepts of OO programming. I've discovered that, the more I learned how to write code at a basic level, the more I started to understand the appeal of order that I've downplayed for so long. I started to attach myself to the satisfaction of single-page solutions with perfect indentation, variables whose source can be quickly located. Now, expanding into collaborating objects, "has many" objects (how many?!), has me freaking out. I'm sure I'll reach a point of feeling powerful again, able to manipulate multiple objects at once, for them to converse and collaborate with one another!
