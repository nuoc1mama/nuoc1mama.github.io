title:  Is Ruby really friendly?

I accidentally started this course in the middle, at JavaScript. 

I had read Eloquent JavaScript and taken JS courses on Codecademy and Linda, so when I was automatically started in the middle of the course, at JavaScript Foundations, I didn't really ask any questions. 

Except I asked a lot of questions. The IDE was unfamiliar, the whole Learn interface took some getting used to, and I wondered why I didn't know the things that the lesson was assuming I already had already learned. It was a rough start, but I *did* already know a lot of the content. When I finally realized that there was a whole treasure trove of lessons before JS Foundations that I had somehow skipped, I was really impressed with myself! I had spent weeks moving through JS lessons with some success (and of course, some frustration) despite missing out on so much foundational knowledge!

Starting over at Ruby granted me the relief of being oriented with Learn and the IDE, course structure, and the basics of CS. Ruby really *was* friendly! Now, as I progress, I'm enjoying looking with more attention and clarity at Ruby as a language and I can't wait to get back into JS. My time learning JS has informed my learning of Ruby and now that I've gotten to know Ruby, so much of the rationale of JS is becoming clear. 

It's this conversation and derivation between languages that really fueled my passion to begin with. I learned math and science in French as a child, then studied sculpture, chemistry, and religion in Italian. The ability knowing just three fairly similar languages gave me to see things through a many-faceted lens has been exciting. Today, I'm learning ASL and of course, how to talk to a computer. Programming isn't so intimate, but it's true that Ruby makes programming friendlier, especially after my rocky start.
